you need following files:
  - clientlogin.conf: these lines are send to the ts3 server when 
                      a new client connects to sqserver
                      you can use something like my clientlogin.example

  - test.key:         the key for the encryption
                      you can create it by using following command:
                      ./sqserver -g [number of bytes] > test.key
